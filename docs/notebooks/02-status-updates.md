**12:47 PM** — Service stubs created

- `createServiceStub()` factory function for 19 services
- All stubs provide health + POST + GET endpoints

**12:48 PM** — Memory receipt system

- `storeInMemory()` now logs to `data/memory-receipts.json`
- Tracks stored vs not-stored, method used, fallback flags
- Added `GET /api/brain/memory-receipts` endpoint

**12:49 PM** — Connectivity pattern logger

- Persistent storage at `data/connectivity-patterns.json`
- Endpoints: `/api/connectivity/patterns`, `/api/connectivity/scan`
- Scanned 24 services, all OK

**12:50 PM** — Container rebuild cycle

- Created missing `services/core-api.js`, `brain_api.js`, `hc_sys_orchestrator.js`
- Wrapped swagger UI in try/catch
- Container rebuilt 3× with port fix (3301:3301)
- 3 commits pushed: `1e8903b`, `6b4d0fe`, `0b98db3`

**1:07 PM** — Notion integration

- Token stored securely in `.env`

## Known Issues & Priorities

| Issue | Priority | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Vector DB fallback (Ollama unavailable in container) | 🔴 HIGH | Memory receipts flagging fallback |
| `/api/health` ordering (registered after SPA fallback) | 🟡 MEDIUM | Pre-existing, works via `/api/soul/health` etc. |
| 32 Dependabot vulnerabilities | 🟡 MEDIUM | 1 critical, 15 high — review needed |
| Swagger UI missing `openapi.yaml` | 🟢 LOW | Wrapped in try/catch, non-blocking |

## Plans & Convergence Tracking

### Near-Term (This Week)

- [ ] Fix Ollama container networking for real vector embeddings
- [ ] Address critical Dependabot vulnerability
- [ ] Complete Notion Knowledge Vault population
- [ ] Set up auto-sync cron for Notion notebooks

### Medium-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

- [ ] Build user authentication (RBAC + subscription tiers)
- [ ] Deploy HeadyWeb production with Firebase auth + Stripe
- [ ] Replace 19 service stubs with real backend logic
- [ ] Implement Perplexity research integration

### Long-Term (Convergence)

- [ ] Saga/workflow compensation pattern
- [ ] Auto-tuning loop for concurrency optimization
- [ ] Hot/cold path separation
- [ ] Skill-based agent routing
- [ ] Event sourcing + CQRS
- [ ] Full OpenTelemetry observability

> Plans should converge to deterministic as patterns stabilize and stubs are replaced with real implementations.

## Maintenance Protocol

- This notebook maintains a **2-day rolling window**
- Sections older than 48 hours are archived by HeadyMaintenance
- Status should be refreshed via `heady_notion sync` or the auto-sync script
- Current sync method: Manual trigger → will be automated via cron/git hooks

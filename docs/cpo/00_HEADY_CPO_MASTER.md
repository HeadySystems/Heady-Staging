# Heady CPO Master Documentation

Last updated: Feb 24, 2026 (America/Denver)
Scope: Strategy + product + platform + security + GTM + operating model across all verticals

## Executive premise (what Heady is “really” becoming)

Heady is converging into an AI execution platform where:

- Every request routes through Heady (IDE, companion, web, APIs)
- Execution is governed and validated (HeadyBattle ethics + Arena Mode + Monte Carlo simulation)
- It’s observable and measurable (registry-driven service health scans, SLO targets, cost tracking endpoint)

The competitive moat isn’t “chat.” It’s: tool access + policy + auditability + quality gates + cross-surface continuity.

---

## Part 1 — The 3 Pillars

### Pillar A — Enterprise platform & orchestration

Core spine: HeadyRegistry + HeadyManager + Headypromoter + HCBrain + monitoring (HeadyLens)

**What exists in the repo that we should productize hard:**

- Registry defines components, AI nodes, routing defaults, pricing, SLOs, services, and “best-practice scores” that literally call out missing circuit breakers/caching/pooling coverage. That is gold for turning ops maturity into product.
- Changelog includes per-request cost tracking endpoint (`/api/brain/claude-usage`) and smart Claude routing. That’s the start of a real “cost governance” story.
- Websites doc lists domain endpoints + orchestrator site generation + “SoulOrchestrator goals”. That’s a product story: “One control plane to run the ecosystem.”

**CPO stance:** Make “Heady Systems” an opinionated platform: you don’t buy models, you buy outcomes with budgets + proof.

### Pillar B — Developer surface (HeadyAI-IDE / Windsurf-first / VS Code base)

You already have two parallel narratives:

- A status report that says HeadyAI-IDE is fully operational, has Arena Mode, multi-model consensus, model router, Monaco editor + file system features.
- A build issue that says: use VS Code OSS + extension approach because Windsurf is proprietary; brand it as HeadyAI-IDE; route ALL AI through Heady.

**CPO stance:**
Your flagship developer loop should be:
`IDE → Heady routes → Arena validates → merge → deploy → show proof + cost + quality score.`
If you can demo that end-to-end reliably, you’ll have a story nobody can dismiss.

### Pillar C — Companion surface (HeadyBuddy + Universal Overlay)

Your repos/issues describe:

- HeadyBuddy config: voice wake word, screen capture interval, approvals for UI actions, background tasks, encryption, opt-out analytics, and integrations toggles (calendar/email/github etc.).
- Universal overlay + task manager: permissions model, privacy controls (`send_screen_to_cloud: false`), performance targets, and phased roadmap.

**CPO stance:**
The companion is your “habit-forming wedge,” but it’s also your biggest trust risk. The winning move is a brutally clear contract:
what it can see, what it stores, what it sends, what it will do without asking, and how users can verify what happened.

---

## Part 2 — The “Make Heady Better” section (deep analysis + what to implement)

### 2.1 The #1 blocker: security credibility gap

Your deep scan issue is explicit: `.env.hybrid` with DB creds committed, pid/log files tracked, backup `.bak` files with logic, missing CI scanning, version drift.

**What to implement (as product + engineering policy):**

- Secret hygiene contract: “No secrets in git, no exceptions.”
- Audit log hygiene: logs should never contain credentials; logs should be redactable by policy.
- Security page as a product artifact: publish the “Heady Trust Contract” (what you log, retention, deletion, data boundaries). This becomes enterprise GTM ammo.

### 2.2 Port / environment drift is killing your operability

You have drift between READMEs (port 3300) and config files (port 3301). The Cloudflare challenges also reveal origin misconfigurations.

**What to implement:**

- A canonical `docs/PORTS_AND_ROUTES.md` generated from registry + runtime configs.
- A “single command health check” that validates port map and domain routing.
- Registry-driven environment contracts: if registry says “service exists,” it must have a health endpoint and be discoverable.

### 2.3 Productize Arena Mode (this is actually your moat)

You define minimum HeadyBattle score ≥ 0.80 and confidence requirements for promotions.

**Turn this into a product:**
“Arena Merge” dashboard in IDE + web showing candidate branches, strategies used, and final winner logic.
**Why it matters:** Every AI coding product is racing toward “agentic changes.” Few can prove why a change is safe. You can.

### 2.4 Cost governance must be first-class

Your directive is “maximum resource utilization”. This is powerful but requires extreme budget discipline.

**What to implement:**

- Every action returns: estimated cost, actual cost, model choice reasons, and a cheaper plan alternative.
- Budgets: per user, org, workspace, and workflow type.

### 2.5 MCP marketplace needs a quality bar

You have an MCP marketplace via `headymcp.com`. Don't let it become a dump.

**What to implement:**

- “Verified connectors” program with permissions declaration and audit compliance.
- Connector scoring: reliability + user satisfaction + cost efficiency.
- Built-in “permission diff” viewer to clearly show security boundaries.

### 2.6 Cloudflare access issues are a distribution killer

Cloudflare 403s block real users.

**What to implement:** A runbook/automation script that validates DNS proxies, origins, and Cloudflare WAF health.

## Part 4 — “Vertical Enablement Kit”

Build these foundational items once, then scale the verticals:

1. **Unified Execution Lifecycle:** Intent → Plan → Tooling (MCP) → Validate (Arena) → Execute → Proof.
2. **Policy Primitives:** Permission ladders (Read, Write, Destructive with MFA/Consensus requirements).
3. **Proof View:** The foundational UI for Heady (showing why routing occurred, final costs, validate traces, options to rollback).
4. **Resilience Defaults:** Implement real circuit breaking, failovers, caching, as identified as lacking by the HeadyRegistry.

## Part 5 — “CPO Choices to Enforce”

- **Fix security first, then scale.** (Handle credentials immediately).
- **The flagship story is “Arena Merge”.** Your clearest differentiator from normal chat interfaces.
- **Don’t fork Chromium first.** Stick to extensions to validate the browser surface; a full browser fork is a 20GB tar-pit right now.
- **Registry becomes the contract.** Push the HeadyRegistry as the real source of truth for ports, pricing, SLOs, services, and architectures.
